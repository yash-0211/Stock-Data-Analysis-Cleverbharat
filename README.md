Task 1: Stock Data Analysis 
1. Using Python, fetch historical stock data for any 5 stocks from the Nifty 50 index using the `yfinance` library. Use a time range of the last 6 months. 
2. Perform the following analyses on the data: 
	a. Calculate the daily percentage change for each stock. 
	b. Plot the closing prices and daily percentage changes for the 5 stocks. 
	c. Calculate the moving average (20-day) for each stock and plot it against the stock's closing price. 

Task 2: Strategy Development 
1. Develop a simple moving average crossover strategy for one of the 5 stocks. The strategy should involve a short-term moving average (e.g., 50-day) and a long-term moving average (e.g., 200-day). 
2. Backtest this strategy on the historical data to identify buy and sell signals. 
3. Calculate the returns generated by the strategy compared to a simple buy-and-hold approach.

Task 3: Risk Management 
1. Calculate the maximum drawdown for each stock over the 6-month period. 
2. For the stock you selected in Task 2, implement a stop-loss mechanism. Assume a stop loss of 5%. Re-run the strategy with the stop-loss and compare the performance to the original strategy.
